# NNLIB

Just playing around with the bare bones of Neural Networks.

[Linear Algebar](`./src/la/mod.rs`) portion of the code inspired by [Numpy](`https://numpy.org/`).
[Neural Network](`https://nnfs.io/`) code taken from here.

This is ongoing, Linear Algebra is not at all optimized and too much memcpys are happening. The way the project is
structured is also not yet ideal and will probably be rearanged soon.
